# StrangeDemonstration

StrangeDemonstration is a [Unity 5](http://unity3d.com/5) project that tries to demonstrate [StrangeIoC](http://strangeioc.github.io/strangeioc/) framework and usage of other libraries by writing "strange" code.

Its examples utilise the MVCS architecture along with patterns like [Observer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), [Command](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern), [Mediator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern), [Object Pool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern), [Dependency Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), etc to provide a modular design to examples.

The examples that have UI based scenes use Unity's new UI system.

Each example (will) have its own wiki page that explains in detail, with code, as to how it does what it does and the whole workflow of the module.

Checkout its [Wiki](https://github.com/AmanAgnihotri/StrangeDemonstration/wiki) pages for more information.
